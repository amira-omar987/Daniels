# Daniels
Explore Daniels project I developed using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. This project served as an exam to assess my proficiency in Bootstrap. The portfolio template is designed to showcase skills, projects, and portfolio in an organized and visually appealing manner. The code and design demonstrate my use of Bootstrap to create a responsive website.
